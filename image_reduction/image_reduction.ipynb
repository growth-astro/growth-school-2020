In reality, doing any sort of scientific analysis on this image as it stands will be a big pain, because it doesn't contain any positional information.  If we wanted to extract information about a particular star or galaxy, or (worse) a whole list of objects, this would be extremely frustrating: we would have to scan the image by eye to find each object, write down its pixel coordinates, and send them one-by-one to our photometry or other analysis code.\n",

Basic header keywords encode the position, pixel scale, and rotation of the image (plus the spherical projection to be used); these are fully standardized and supported by nearly all astronomical software.  Additional keywords provide distortion terms to allow for deviations from perfectly rectilinear CCD/optics, although unfortunately there are several conflicting conventions for treating distortions and there is no guarantee that your software will support them correctly.\n",
