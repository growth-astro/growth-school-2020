    "Extract a 1-D spectrum from a 2-D image of a long-slit spectrum, determine wavelength solution, and then measure the redshift of the target.\n",

    "## Key steps\n",
    "- determine the mapping between pixel coordinates and lines of constant wavelength\n",
    "- create and subtract a 2D model of the sky background from the science image\n",
    "- determine the mapping between pixel coordinates and lines of constant spatial position\n",
    "- extract (sum) the background subtracted target counts in each wavelength bin\n",
    "- determine the wavelengths for each wavelength bin\n",
    "- identify line features in the extracted spectrum and use the known rest wavelength to compute a redshift\n",
    "- normalize a flat field image wavelength bin by wavelength bin and correct the images for pixel-to-pixel efficiencies \n",
    "- extract a spectrum of a \"standard star\" with a known flux densities\n",
    "- use the standard star spectrum to calibrate the instrumental response function\n",
    "- use the response function to convert the target counts into flux densities\n",
    "- identify telluric absorption features in the standard star spectrum and correct the target spectrum for these absorption bands\n",

The image has already been process to remove bias, and the image has been trimmed and rotated (what we will call \"rows\" are actually columns on the CCD).

If the target extends over many pixels in the spatial direction or the tilt/curvature of the lines of constant wavelength is large, you may have to take into account the changes in wavelength with row number.

For this exersize we will simply calculate a weighted average in each wavelength bin rather than fitting a model to the data.

These bands can be seen in the spectra of our standard star. The target spectrum is also absorbed in these bands. We can correct for this by measuring the fraction of the standard star's light absorbed as a function of wavelength compared to an extrapolation of the standard star's continuum across these bands. We can then scale this absorption strength to match the fractional absorption in the target spectrum and thus divide out the telluric absorption.
